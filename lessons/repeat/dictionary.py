["overall, your pace in this recording was likely much too fast for any audience -- a wall of words. Speaking too quickly makes it \

["overall, your pace in this recording was likely too fast for any audience over 30 people. \
It leaves the audience very little time to think and catch up, and you risk leaving people behind",

It may sound over-rehearsed -- there's no real \"conversation\" happening with the audience.",

At a pace like this, it's hard to project authority or create meaningful tension. You may make mistakes \

congratulatory or motivational speech -- for conveying passion. It may be less effective, \
though, in conveying thoughtfulness or authority -- for conveying wisdom",

You're giving yourself options -- you can even choose to throw in some faster short passages for emphasis",

Think about slowing down for any audience over 30 people, and adding changes of intensity to create a sense \
of conversation"

control of your thoughts and words, and gave the audience plenty of time to absorb \
what you said"],
