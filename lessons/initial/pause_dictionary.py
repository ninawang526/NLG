["overall, your pace in this recording was likely too fast for any audience over 30 people. \
It leaves the audience very little time to think and catch up, and you risk leaving people behind",

It may sound over-rehearsed -- there's no real \"conversation\" happening with the audience.",

At a pace like this, it's hard to project authority or create meaningful tension. You may make mistakes \

You're giving yourself options -- you can even choose to throw in some faster short passages for emphasis",

Think about slowing down for any audience over 30 people, and adding changes of intensity to create a sense \
of conversation"

by helping everyone in the audience follow your arguments. You used silence and pauses \
to add emphasis and exploit contrasts",

you're giving yourself options to respond to the audience"

control of your thoughts and words, and gave the audience plenty of time to absorb \
what you said"],

especially very large audiences or for a speech delivered in open air. You showed respect \
